# Introduction
## Blurb
test
This short course covers the core skills required for a budding R user to develop a strong foundation for data analysis in the RStudio environment. Within the framework of a reproducible research workflow we will cover importing and cleaning data, efficient coding practices, writing your own functions and using the powerful `dplyr` data manipulation tools. 

## Key Topics

* Reproducible Research
* R Studio and project management
* Importing and cleaning data
* Good coding practices in R
* standard control structures
* Vectorisation and `apply` functions
* Writing your own funcitons
* Data manipulation with `dplyr`
* Piping/chaining commands


## Course information

**Intended audience**	Anyone interested in quantitative data analysis using open source tools.

**Prior knowledge** Knowledge of R (as covered in R: An introduction).

**Resources**	Course handbook

**Software** RStudio & 	R 3.1.2

**Format**	Presentation with practical exercises

**Where next?**	R:

# Reproducible Research [presentation only]

## Why?

* Reinhart Rogoff Excel spreadsheet



#  Set-up [presentation and practical]
## RStudio
## Project management
## Literate programming

### Consistent coding style e.g.:
* Google style guide
* Hadley Wickhamâ€™s style guide

### Commenting 

## \* Bonus section: github

## PRACTICAL: new R project

* personalise RStudio settings (don't save .Rdata etc)
* new project folder with subfolders (data, figures, scripts)
* new Rproject




# Workflow
## Importing data
The original data should be read-only!! 

* url
* unzip
* (colClasses)

## Data tidying
* gather/ spread

## PRACTICAL: Import and clean some data

* download and import data
* do some `tidyr` stuff with it
* think about commenting and file structure!

# Efficient Coding

## Standard control structures

### Conditional execution

### Looping

### PRACTICAL

## Vecotrisation  and`apply` family of funcitons



### PRACTICAL 

benchmarking apply vs for loops


## Writing your own functions

### objects, types, environments

### passing arguments

### PRACTICAL 


## Data manipulation with `dplyr`

### Subsetting

* `filter`
* `sample`
* `slice`
* `distinct`
* `select`

### Grouping

* `group_b`

### Summarizing

### Making new variables

* `mutate`

### Piping/chaining daisies 

### PRACTICAL 

## FINAL PRACTICAL

something along the lines of: 

* Fun1: a function to be called in summarize or mutate (e.g. z-score)

* Fun2: a chain (that calls Fun1), and then filters the table in some way

* Fun3: a plotting function that takes the result of Fun2
